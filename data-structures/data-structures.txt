# DataStrcutres 

> what is datastrcture? what is the advantage ?
- It is a way of orgnanizing and storing data
- Majorily is used for optimizing the performance
Ex: LinkedList, Queue, Array etc....

> Types of datastrcture?
- Linear [sequencial]: Linked list, queues, stack
- Non-linear: Trees & graphs 

> what are variables in programming language ? how many types are there ?
- variables are used for storing the data
- They are classified into two types
  - System Datatypes [Primitive Datatypes]: int, float, double etc..
  - User Defined Datatypes [classes in java]: classes in java

> ADT [Abstract Data type]
- It is process of combining the right datastructure with their operations

> what is the size of datatype in system ? say 'int' has 2 bytes ?
- No, it is compiler dependent

> what is algorithm ? why ?
- It is step by step procedure to solve a given problem
- It helps determining picking best solution among various

> What is asymtotic analysis? why do we need ?
- It is a process of determing the solution for a problem by coming datastructures to the functional inputs
- It helps determining space and time complexity for a problem in terms of best, average and worst case

> Best way to determine runtime analysis of algorithm ? is it based on number of iterations, number of statements execution ...
- It is done by Rate of growth

> Rate of growth ? commonly used ?
- it is process of analysing the increase of time against the function of inputs 
  - 1 -> constant: add element to first of linked list
  - log n -> logarithmic: search element in sorted array
  - n -> linear: search element in un-sorted array
  - n logn -> linear logarithmic: sort element by devide and conquor technique [Merge sort]
  - n^2 -> Quadrantic: shortest path b/w nodes
  - 2^n -> Exponential: Tower of hanoi problem

> In case of programs, which type of cases needs to considered ?
- Ideally, worst cases

# Linked Lists
> What is linked list datastructure? what are its properties ?
- It is the linear datastructure used for storing collection of data
- Properties
  - Traverses in forward direction
  - No wastage of memory
  - Can grow and shrink dynamically
  - Extra memory for references or pointer
  - Last node reference is NULL
  - It contains Node [data field + reference field]

> When to use arrays and when not to use ?
- Use
  - Simple and easy to use
  - Faster search [access] in constant time
- Not to use
  - Memory is dynamic
  - Memory wastage as size is pre-allocated
  - One block of execution
  - Poor performance while perfroming insertion / deletion operation based on positions

> When to use linked list and when not to use ?
- Use
  - Memory is dynamic [Expandable in constant time]
  - No memory wastage
  - Good performance while perfroming insertion / deletion operation in constant time
- Not to use
  - Extra memory for pointers or references
  - Slower search [access] for individual elements
