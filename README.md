> Java Memory Model
- Explain about model and its sections deeply

> Class Loaders
- Relevance of class loaders ? who executes and when
- Types ? default used

> Object
- Creation in different ways ?
- Relevance of this k/w ?
- Variables & its default values
- Constructor & its chaining process ? use of this & super inside it ?

> Garbage Collectors
- Types [G1, CMS etc..] and default once as per the versions 

> Hashing
- How is it done ? relevance ? pitfalls ?
- Hash Collision, how it occurs & its resolution

> Object Methods
- equals() and hashcode() contract & its implications if not implemented [Hash Collision]
- wait(), notify() & notifyAll() for Thread communication
- clone() for cloning the objects

> OOPS concepts
- Explain all concepts with example
- Polymorphism & its types

> Abstract Class Vs Interface
- Explain with example & real-world scenario
